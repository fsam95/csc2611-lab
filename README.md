This repo contains all of my code for CSC2611-lab. 
Running part_1_script.sh generates the results for part 1 (synchronic embeddings) while
part_2.script.sh generates results for part 2 (diachronic embeddings). 

The Part 1 script assumes that you have the `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin` in the same directory and 
the Part 2 script assumes that you have the `data.pkl` file in the same directory.
